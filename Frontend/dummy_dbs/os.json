      {
        "id": 10,
        "question": "Explain the concept of paging in memory management.",
        "answer": "Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory, dividing memory into fixed-size pages to prevent fragmentation.",

      },
      {
        "id": 13,
        "question": "What is swapping in memory management?",
        "answer": "Swapping is a process management technique in which processes are temporarily moved from main memory to disk and brought back as needed, helping manage memory efficiently.",
